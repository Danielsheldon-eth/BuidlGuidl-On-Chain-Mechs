# BuidlGuidl-On-Chain-Mechs
A small Set of Manga inspired Collectible trading Cards with a bonus customisable NFT if the collection is complete.
The project is a generative layered SVG concept. 
The design features a Mecha bot with various limb types, being ridden by a Manga inspired character. 
There are currently 7 layered traits. From a Background Theme, Background Overlay, pod interioir, Rider, Pod body, Mech Limbs and a Symbol overlay. Of which we will do 7-10 variants. 
The images will be reminiscent of a comic book cover with Japanese Kanji Symbol overlay
The idea is to create 7-10 final unique card design variations and release them in blind packs of 2-3 random cards.  
Users mint the blind packs and try to build up a complete collection. THis is done by either purchasing more packs or trading with other users. 
Upon completing their collection a User will unlock the fully customisable SVG NFT that contains all the traits and be able to make their own permutation to use as they wish.
There may be a few Golden bonus single-edition cards as easter Eggs hidden in some packs.
